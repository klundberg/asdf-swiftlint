In some cases, you may want fine-grained control over whether or not you use the latest version of swiftlint. New versions may introduce new opt-out rules that you're not prepared to fix yet, for instance.

If this is the case, you can use this asdf plugin to manage your swiftlint versions in the same way you would manage versions of ruby or node.js with asdf.
